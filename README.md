# Protofall's Homebrew Tests

This repository is basically a bunch of my projects I've worked on for multiple Graphics systems. KallistiOS/KOS (Dreamcast) and Processing (Windows/Mac/Linux). KallistiOS is a free, BSD license-based development system for the Sega Dreamcast game console.

### Legal

Legal definitions really aren't my strength, they fly high above my head, so I'm probably forgetting to say something that the BSD license requires me to say. Just pretend that missing stuff is here or google what the BSD license is for yourself I guess. Also obligatory *If you use this and break something its not my fault, don't sue me ok?* message, I think thats a part of the BSD.
