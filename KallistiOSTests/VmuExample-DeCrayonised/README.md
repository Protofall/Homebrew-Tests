# Crayon Vmu

There are two versions of the crayon vmu system. This is the old version. It has no backwards compatibility or portablility (Dreamcast only). The new versions supports backwards compatibility and portability. This all stems from the fact that C has no easy way to serialise a struct so the old method was flawed and the new method fully works.

NOTE: If you only intend your savefiles to exist on just Dreamcast or don't care about supporting savefile versioning, then the old version is probably for you.

You can find the new version here:
