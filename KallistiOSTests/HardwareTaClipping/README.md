# HARDWARE/TA cropping

This demo was largely based of Tapnam's work which you can find in the "OTHER-PEOPLES-WORK" folder. I modified it here to show it from different angles as well as the "draw outside of" part. The grey rectangle represents the boundry for the cropping in this test.

### CONTROLS

A: Cycles between no crop, keep inside and keep outside modes.
X: Generates new positions for the sprites
START: End demo and stutdown
