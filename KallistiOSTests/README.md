Here is a list of some the projects and how much of them came from other sources or were original:

### Fade
Code made by TapamN that utilises the oargb parameter

### Kmg
Contains code from this guide: http://dcemulation.org/?title=KMG_Textures

### MyC++PNG
Its just the PNG example included with the kos-ports converted to C++ with a few minor changes

### Palette/PaletteSD
It heavily borrows from bogglez's Spritesheet tutorial using texconv to make the paletted texture files, code to load them in and drawing sprites instead of polygons. I removed all the Spritesheet stuff to simplify this example, added swappable romdisks and included a function that can display messages and stops the program (Useful for error debugging). Bogglez's tutorial on spritesheets/paletted textures can be found here: http://dcemulation.org/?title=PVR_Spritesheets

### RomdiskSwapping
The code to load in the GZ compressed and non-compressed romdisk images came from BlackAura. The fork of img4dc was made by Kazade. The makefiles for the "JamoHTP-Protofall" versions were made by JamoHTP

### VmuSavefile
Contains modified code from this guide: http://dcemulation.org/?title=Filesystem
and also modified versions of BlueCrab's CrabEmu savefile code

### Other
There are more projects here, WIP.
